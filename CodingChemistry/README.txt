Welcome to Mr. Estephan's Coding Chemistry Program! I'm thrilled to have you here, eager to dive into the fascinating world of Chemistry. This program is designed to be your comprehensive guide through the Periodic Table, providing valuable insights into each element's:

-Atomic Number
-Atomic Mass
-Quantity of protons, neutrons, and electrons
-Position in the table (group and period) along with its elemental classification (metal, nonmetal)
-Electron Configuration and abbreviated configuration using the nearest Noble Gas.

To get started, ensure you download the PeriodicTableDataBase.db and save it to your desktop. Once done, fire up Visual Studio, run the program, and let the learning begin!

This program boasts three key features:

-Query your database using raw SQL queries (not EF).
-Create and populate a list with various values, retrieving at least one value to utilize in your program.
-Employ the SOLID principle, among other best practices!

Your time and interest in exploring my work are greatly appreciated. I trust this program aligns with your expectations. 

Stay classy and enjoy your exploration!

Kindly, 

Mr. Bernard Estephan
